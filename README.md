# Convulse

CONVULSE:  mean computer tells you to do things (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻  Use your head (literally) to follow instructions. 
- Emote when told, shift when told! Task: Tilt to direction, Change Emotions, Sway


- Uses Webcam
- Detects Face (Haar cascades)
  
- Detects Facial Emotions with CNN (Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, Disgust, Fear, Surprise)
    
- Detects Motion (Swaying)
- Manipulates Webcam imagery (Video effects for added difficulty)

Inspiration: Bop-it but with your face


- Python + OpenCV image handling - webcam 
- Object detection (face, person, vehicle) - detects ur face 
- Object tracking and motion analysis - detects your action
- Image manipulation and processing - glitches your screen to make it harder
- Visualizing CNN features - Emotions
